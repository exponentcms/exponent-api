# The current toolbar builder isn&acirc;Äôt GUI friendly, but moderately easy learning curve. look at : http://docs.cksource.com/CKEditor_3.x/Developers_Guide/Toolbar for creating your own editor configuration. You&acirc;Äôll only want what&acirc;Äôs inside the initial square braces &acirc;Äú[&acirc;Äú.
# A close button has been added to the message queue.
# New Administrative Chrome styles.
# The &acirc;ÄúThis Page and This Modules&acirc;Äù menu in the Slingbar has been renamed to &acirc;ÄúPages&acirc;Äù and is no longer context sensitive to alleviate confusion.

# Many module&acirc;Äôs views and styles have been adjusted as we continue to nail down module development patterns and best practices.
# Many &acirc;Äúold school&acirc;Äù (1.0 codeline) modules have been removed from the distributed package for incompatibility reasons.
# &acirc;ÄúSite Configuration&acirc;Äù within the Slingbar&acirc;Äôs Exponent &gt; Configure &gt; Configure Site option has been overhauled and made more user friendly.
